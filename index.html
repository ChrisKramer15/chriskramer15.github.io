            <h1>Chris Kramer</h1>
            <h3>Full-Stack Software Engineer</h3>
            <p>Coding has always been so intriguing.  How can something be connected to every business in the world?  It must be super exclusive that only geniuses can get into!</p>
            <p>Not exactly.  It is an industry that never ceases to stop growing, a continuously changing environment.  As soon as I got a taste of "Hello, World!", my curiosity has been unsatisfied.</p>
            <p>From military to warehouse managerial experience, I have been challenged in various levels.  Tech is where I want to be, and I cannot wait for the challenges to come forth.  I do enjoy to watch challenges fall apart due to my own drive.</p>
