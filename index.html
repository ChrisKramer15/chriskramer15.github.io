            <h4>Curiosity</h4>
            <p>
              Coding has always been so intriguing. How can something be
              connected to every business in the world? It must be super
              exclusive that only geniuses can get into!

            <h4>Beginning Steps</h4>
            <p>
              Not exactly. It is an industry that never ceases to stop growing,
              a continuously changing environment. As soon as I got a taste of
              <strong>"Hello, World!"</strong>, my curiosity has been
              unsatisfied.

            <h4>The Future</h4>
            <p>
              I love to network and expand my experience and knowledge. Connect
              with me on the Contact Page or browse my resume.
